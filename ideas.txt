Admin's can search for users
Admin's can delete users and/or their patches
View patches in real time without re-uploading (will require an exe to be called as there is no PHP implementation of LZMA)
Make the upload bar look better (will probably use bootstrap styles..)
Create fingerprint.json file for a single patch or all patches
Store last password and password change time in db
