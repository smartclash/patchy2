Admin's can search for users
Admin's can delete users and/or their patches
View patches in real time without re-uploading (will require an exe to be called as there is no PHP implementation of LZMA)
Make the upload bar look better (will probably use bootstrap styles..)
Make configuring the site easier
Force first_run.php (previously install.php) to be removed before using patchy
