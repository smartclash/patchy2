# Patchy2
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The free patch management solution built in PHP with MySQL
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is now the official patchy repo, because this one uses a different(more secure) password storing method

Each version is in a subfolder and contains new features

Updates will be published around every 1 - 3 months unless a security flaw is discovered in which case asap.
    
So long as the homepage links to this repo I don't mind if you use it commerically.
