The free patch management solution built in PHP with MySQL

This is now the official patchy repo, because this one uses a different(more secure) password storing method

Each version is in a subfolder and contains new features

Updates will be published around every 1 - 3 months unless a security flaw is discovered in which case asap.

The officical site for patchy is:

    http://patchy.co.nf

Setup is as follows:

1.
  
  	Create the database using the installer (install.php)

2.
  
  	Edit the config file to your liking (/assets/php/main/config.php)
  	
  	Add your database to the db.php file (/assets/php/main/db.php)

3.
	Stay tuned for updates, apart from that, your done :)


So long as the homepage links to this repo I don't mind if you use it.
