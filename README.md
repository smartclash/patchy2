The free patch management solution built in PHP with MySQL
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This version contains security fixes as well as some bug fixes which were in patchy 2.0, this is an optional update and shouldn't require the database to be altered.

Updates will be published around every 1 - 3 months unless a security flaw is discovered in which case asap.

The officical site for patchy is:

So long as the homepage links to this repo I don't mind if you use it commerically.
